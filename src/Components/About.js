      <p>
        I have always loved languages. After graduating from Washington State University with my Master of Arts in Education, I worked as a Fitness Coordinator and volleyball coach or one year, and then started a career teaching English as a foreign language.
      </p>
      <p>
        This took me all over China and Mexico, with short stops in many other locations while working remotely. I love traveling and learning the languages, cuisines, and cultures of the world. I try to respect each culture deeply, which has helped me learn to speak Spanish and Mandarin Chinese. 
      </p>
      <p>
        There is not a large demand for English as a second language teachers within the United States, so I started looking for other career possibilities that allowed me to stay in my home country. I spoke to some close friends about my ideas, and one suggested coding because of my attention to detail. I started taking some online courses, and I found out <strong>I love computer languages as much as human languages.</strong> I researched coding bootcamps, chose Flatiron because their free content was well written and informative, applied, and attended their tuition-deferred Brooklyn campus called Access Labs. 
      </p>

        <strong>I'm so happy I decided to learn to code!</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy every aspect of coding. If I had to pick my favorite parts, they'd be problem solving, creating something from just an idea, the excitement of seeing your cool features work, and joining a profession that is community-oriented. 
      </p>
      <p>As a recent graduate of Flatiron, I am currently unemployed and looking for a company that will utilize my hard work, dedication, quick learning, and attention to detail.</p>

      <h3>Personal Life</h3>
      <p>
        Both of my parents were volleyball coaches, and I continue to love the sport. I played outside hitter and libero at Limestone College, and I was the volunteer coach with Washington State University for three seasons under Jen Greeny. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In my spare time, I like to learn - languages, linguistics, cooking, geography, current world affairs, coding, and more information about topics involved in my coding projects. For example, I tried to learn more about nutrition while creating my Flatiron capstone project, the macronutrient tracker <i>HAM</i>. And, of course, <strong>I enjoy coding in my spare time!</strong>

      <p>
        I believe coding was the right choice for my professional life. During my life, I hope to have a positive impact on those around me through volunteering, solving community problems (now with code, too!), maintaining and increasing my involvement in causes I support, and hopefully through the local economy via an administrative role, local government, or both.
